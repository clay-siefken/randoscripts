# randoscripts

Hi.

This is a collection of the random scripts I use to keep my poop in a group.

# TODO: API integrations

- [x] Github: my code 
  - this was actually kind of a dumb add. github has its own client.
- [ ] Todoist: my plans
- [ ] Plaid: my money
- [ ] Dropbox: my data
- [ ] Google Docs: my thoughts
- [ ] Fitbit: my body
- [ ] Overleaf: my writing

# TODO: Capabilities
- [ ] Keeping this in a README is stupid
  - [ ] script to add items to a Todoist project
  - [ ] script to list items in a Todoist project
  - [ ] script to complete items in a Todoist project
